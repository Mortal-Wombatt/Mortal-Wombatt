- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mortal-Wombatt. I'm an Aussie originally from the outback with no qualifications or experience and I basically just fumble around with computers and stuff
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and generative AI, desktop GUI applications, database development and long walks on the beach
- 🐍 I mainly code in python and I'm a champ at VB. I have some experience with C#, Javascript and Lua
- 🌱 I’m currently learning network simulations 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I love to learn new things and theres no better way than to jump into the deep end.
- 📫 How to reach me
